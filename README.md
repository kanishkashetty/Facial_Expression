# Facial_Expression

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for facial expression recognition. 

1. Load the dataset 
2. Preprocessing the image data by reshaping and normalizing pixel values.
3. Building a CNN model architecture using convolutional and pooling layers.
4. Compiling the model with appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
5. Training the model with a training-validation split and using callbacks for model checkpointing.
6. Evaluating the model's performance on the test data and making predictions on sample images.
